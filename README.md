# Birdseye
Sometimes it's a pain to have to run a multitude of git commands before working to get an overview of the repository state. I wronte this script to give me a birdseye view of a repository.

## How do I make it go?
- Download the script and store it where you please. I recommend adding it to a location on your `$PATH` for maximum accessibility.
- Make sure you grant your user execution permission: `chmod u+x birdseye.sh`
- All that's left is to run the script from within a valid git repository!

## Runtime options
- `birdseye.sh [ -h | --help ]`: display the help message
